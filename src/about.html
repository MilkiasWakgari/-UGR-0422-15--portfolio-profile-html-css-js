            <article>
                <p> I come from Addis Ababa, a city perched on the highlands, kissed by the sun and cradled by the
                    rhythm of a rich, ancient culture. It is here, amidst bustling streets and warm-hearted people, that
                    my journey began—a journey shaped by hope, faith, and endless curiosity.</p>
                <p>I dream of traveling the world, not just to see it, but to feel it. To stand in awe of towering
                    mountains that scrape the skies, to walk along shores where the ocean whispers its secrets, to lose
                    myself in forests that echo with the heartbeat of creation. God's work, in its infinite beauty, is
                    my map and my compass, guiding me to marvel at His hand in every sunrise and every horizon.</p>
                <p>But travel is not just movement it is discovery. I want to hear stories told in languages unfamiliar
                    yet universal, to taste the spices of cultures that speak of history and heritage. I long to immerse
                    myself in the breathtaking diversity of humanity, to learn, to love, and to grow.</p>
                <p>As I walk this path, one truth grounds me: “It doesn’t matter who we are, what matters is our plan.”
                    For life is not about where we come from but where we choose to go. It is the journey of purpose
                    that defines us, the steps we take with faith and determination.</p>
                <p>My path may start in the streets of Addis, but it stretches far beyond—across oceans, over deserts,
                    and into the unknown. It is a journey of wonder and gratitude, a quest to experience the vast
                    tapestry of life woven by the Creator’s touch. </p>
                <p>Each place I visit, every soul I meet, will be a brushstroke on the canvas of my life, painting a
                    picture of unity, awe, and purpose. For I believe this world is not just a collection of places—it
                    is a masterpiece waiting to be admired, cherished, and shared. This is my story.</p>
                <p>This is my calling. And this is just the beginning.</p>
